Generate [NUMBER] YouTube video scripts.

Each script should have a maximum duration of around 60 seconds and around 500 Chracters and cover topics from Diet, Nutrition, Funny Facts, History, and Country History.

These scripts must be both clickbait-style to immediately grab attention and genuinely informative, ensuring the core information presented is accurate.

Each script must be designed to maximize viewer retention and engagement by:

- Starting with a compelling curiosity gap that immediately grabs attention.
- Clearly promising a specific benefit or valuable takeaway within the first few sentences.
- Building intrigue and suspense by strategically revealing information.
- Using strong emotional language and evocative descriptions where appropriate.
- Maintaining a fast pace and incorporating variety in sentence structure and content delivery.
- Framing information within a relatable context or addressing the viewer directly.
- Ending with a _single, random_ call to action (either "like the video," "subscribe to the channel," or ask video relevent question so that they answer in comment). Do not include more than one of these CTAs in a single script.

The target audience for these videos is Young and Mid-Aged.

Provide the output in a markdown table with four columns: `SL`, `ID`, `Title`, `Script`, `Hashtags`, and `image prompt`.

For `SL` Column, it's incremental number
for `ID` Column, it's incremental number with subject like - health-1, health-2, health-3 or fun-1, fun-2, fun-3

For the `image prompt` column: Go through each sentence in the `Script`. For each sentence, identify a key visual element, keyword, or phrase that could serve as an image prompt for that specific part of the script. List these prompts as a comma-separated string in the `image prompt` column for that script.

Ensure all generated scripts are unique and do not repeat concepts from previous requests.
