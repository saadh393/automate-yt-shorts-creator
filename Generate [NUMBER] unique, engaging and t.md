### 📄 **Output Format**

Provide the results in a Markdown table with the following columns:

| SL | ID | Title | Script | Hashtags | image prompt |
| -- | -- | ----- | ------ | -------- | ------------ |

#### Column Details:

* `SL`: Incremental number (e.g., 1, 2, 3...)
* `ID`: A unique slug per entry, combining topic and index (e.g., `health_benefits_1`, `fun_facts_2`)
* `Title`: Short, engaging video title (used as YouTube caption).
* `Script`: 500-character max, structured per the script writing guidelines above.
* `Hashtags`: Exactly 5 viral and topic-relevant hashtags.
* `Image Prompt`: First, analyze the entire script to identify its main topic and overall narrative theme. Then, for each sentence except the last (which is a CTA for like, comment, and subscribe), create a concise, clear, and highly relevant image prompt that visually captures both the main topic and the specific meaning of that sentence. Ensure all image prompts follow a consistent visual pattern and explicitly reflect the central theme of the script. Each prompt should be optimized for pollinations.ai, including a negative prompt to exclude any text or captions within the image. Finally, output all image prompts as a single comma-separated string that together represents the flow, tone, and key ideas of the video script.
